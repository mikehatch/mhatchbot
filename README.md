# mhatchbot
My first bot framework bot

Choir Genius use cases:
- Events 
  - "When is the next X event?" type (Rehearsal, Performance, Meeting, etc.)
  - Bot initiated notification of event added?
  - RSVP for events
  - Show totals for rsvp

Decisions to make:
- Multi-chorus/multi-slack site members - one bot for all CG sites? A bot for each chorus?

To do's:
- Mapping of Choir Genius users to slack or other IM users?
- Storage
- Customize for slack ephemeral messages or replacing messages to avoid polluting the channels
- Implement language support for choir genius use cases (above)
